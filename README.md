# Junoships

Monetized game of Battleships on the blockchain.

Credit to Ania Kubow, codeSTACKr, and Web Dev Simplified for [https://github.com/kubowania/battleships](their Battleships game) from which Junoships is derived.

This game's debut was on a "big block" Bitcoin fork.

Now it's being rewritten for Juno Network or possibly its own sovereign Battleships blockchain.

Work in progress!
